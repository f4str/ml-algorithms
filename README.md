# Neural Networks Sandbox

Implementations of various neural networks for recognizing handwritten digit. Training data is taken from the [MNIST handwritten digit database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). Several neural networks are modified implementations based on Michael Nelsons book [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/).
